# Free Starting Cities (You can sail to)

## Ab'Dendriel

- Grillbrick Dendriel
- Gabagoni Loca

Main City of the elves - lots of trees, bug milk and stuff that easily burns...
Sorry, just thinking aloud. Ahem. Very cosy and safe I guess if your fond of
nature.

## Carlin

- Grillbrick Carlin

A city ruled by forthright independent women. Very clean and safe, but also very
strict on the booze, alas.

## Venore

- Grillbrick Venore

Hohoh, one of the richest cities, filled with merchants and LOOT! Err. I mean,
there's a lot to gain from that city. Don't know why they built it over a
stinking swamp though.

## Thais (or Thais Peninsula)

Old-school city. Actually the oldest main city in Tibia. Be careful on those
streets there are bandits everywhere.


# Free Starting Cities (You can't sail to)

## Kazordoon

The underground dwarven city. Doesn't have a real harbour, so I can't bring you
there, sorry.

Can walk there from
- Ab'Dendriel
- Carlin
- Thais
- Venore

## Svargrond

Negative, can't bring you there. You gotta pass some sort of Barbarian test
before they let you live there. Still, you should go there sometime, I heard
it's quite interesting.

Magic Carpet from
- Kazordoon
- Durashia
- Edron
- Issavi
- Femor Hills

## Yalahar

Now that must be one of the biggest cities I've ever seen. Might be not cosy for
a newcomer like yourself, though. And I can't sail there anyway... The don't let
everyone enter their fine pretty harbour, they're a bit particular.

Boat from
- Liberty Bay

# Premium Cities (you can sail to)

## Ankrahmun

Desert pyramid city close to the ocean, some underground tombs where I heard it's not bad hunting.

## Darashia

One of the two desert cities. Built around a lovely oasis. Lions, dragons... decent location for a newcomer.

## Edron

Quiet little castle city on an island in the north-eastern part of Tibia. Trolls, goblins, rotworms... good place for starters, too.

## Liberty Bay

Liberty Bay is on an island group in the South Seas. Ah, home sweet home. Err. I mean, it's pirates galore. Good deal of tortoises, too. Just be careful, then it's a good hunting location.

## Port Hope

Port Hope is an outpost right in the middle of the jungle. ...Apes, bananas, hydras, tarantulas... Who'd want to go there? Except for crazy adventurers like these guys here on the island, obviously.
