 ALYN SHIR
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Diplomat, spy, or saboteur, few things are certain about the secretive
Dokkalfar agent named Alyn Shir. Most know her as a charming and scandalous
ambassador. The Alfar armies know her as a cunning and unpredictable ally. A
rare few know her as a fearsome and merciless assassin—but never for long. When
asked, Alyn Shir is willing to spin any number of tales about her past.
Sometimes, she is the least daughter of a minor noble, inheriting only a pair of
ancient daggers and a disdain for those who think that power will protect them.
In others, she was born a street urchin and survived through stealth and
cunning. The only certainty is that as the war rages on, this singular woman has
found more and more need for her knives, and no one can be certain where her
true loyalty lies.

 AGARTH, FATEWEAVER
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Once known across Amalur as the Blade of Avgruun, Agarth was renowned for his
exceptional courage and strength. With each victory, word of his combat prowess
spread throughout the Faelands. Agarth had wealth, power, and prestige. But more
than a decade ago, Agarth retired his blade, shocking those who knew him best.
Offering little explanation, he gave away the riches he had earned and joined
the Fateweaver order.

  Agarth had discovered that he possessed the gift of foresight. Unfortunately,
his insight into Fate brought him troubling visions. He turned to the bottle for
refuge, falling from his former glory into obscurity and anonymity. Although
Agarth now hides behind the haze of drink, those who look close will see a man
whose greatness can still return...

 HIGH KING TITARION
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  The High King of the Summer Court has ruled his people with the warmth and
ageless vision of the ancient sun. Unlike most Fae, who look on mortals with
caution, Titarion is eager to share his wisdom with the young races. Beloved by
all in the Court of Summer, he sits above the politics of the court. However,
with Gadflow's treachery and the breaking of the Great Cycle of the Fae,
Titarion’s radiance has fallen into shadow.

  Now the Summer King broods upon his throne, troubled by the changes that
herald the end of his kingdom. His subjects fear for him, for the Fae have never
known change or true death, and they cannot understand his warnings. For now,
Titarion must wait, hoping for a way to prevent the Long Winter.

 TEMPLAR OCTIENNE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  With a personal fortune and authority over dozens of the greatest gnome
Scholars of the age, Templar Ligotti Octienne wields power and influence other
gnomes can only aspire to. However, his own aspirations reach much further than
mere wealth or victory in the political games of Adessa’s council.

  Octienne is known among the other Templars for his arrogance. Some even dare
whisper that a number of the projects he supports defy the laws of Adessa,
although no proof of misdeed has ever been presented to the other Templars.

  Octienne is a gifted scholar in his own right, but he left the academy for
political pursuits, believing his goals were better served in the Forum. He has
used his influence among the Templars to support the development of the Well of
Souls and few know of the project’s true goal. Despite the difficulty of
protecting the Scholars in his employ from the scrutiny of the outside world
and the dangers of the war-torn countryside, Octienne is confident he will
succeed in his plans.

 GENERAL TILERA
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  When the Tuatha marched on the Plains of Erathell without warning 12 years
ago, the Alfar hastily organized an army under the command of General Tilera at
Gwydion to strike back against the assault. Although the campaign was costly,
Tilera eventually drove the enemy out of Erathell and back into the swamps of
Klurikon.

  But the war was not over. Tilera’s loss following the appearance of the
monstrous Balor on the Day of the Pale Swans allowed the Tuatha to push back and
lay siege to the fortress of Mel Senshir. And there the battle lines of war have
stood for the past nine years.

  Tilera, ashamed of her failure even in the face of such hopeless odds,
resigned her commission and set out on a journey to uncover an ancient weapon
that legends say can kill the Balor. Tilera knows that it is only a matter of
time before the Tuatha call the Balor to the walls of Mel Senshir, turn the tide
of the battle in their favor, and sweep across the Faelands once again.

 FOMOROUS HUGUES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Focused, dedicated, and visionary -- these words have all been uttered in the
great Librarium of Adessa about the Scholar Fomorous Hugues. Little is known
about Hugues’ life before his graduation from the academy. Following a brief
professorship in Adessa, Hugues dedicated himself to a single project: the Well
of Souls. The benevolent professor seeks to cease all war and, indeed, prevent
any sentient mortal creature from meeting an unnatural end.

  Although the project has yet to yield a success, the Fateweaver Agarth has
seen it written in Fate’s tapestry that Hugues will succeed. Unfortunately,
Agarth has also foreseen that Hugues’ success will come at the cost of his own
life.

|  The human clans known as the Varani can be found throughout Amalur, as much |
| at home on the high seas as in the villages and outposts they inhabit.       |
| Though not as culturally refined as the Almain, the Varani have brought      |
| commerce and a degree of civilization to the wilds of the Faelands.          |
|                                                                              |
|  While lacking political motivation for involvement in the war against the   |
| Tuatha, many Varani have found employment fighting in the mortal armies as   |
| mercenaries. The battle-hardened fierceness of the Varani has given them a   |
| well-earned reputation as a valuable ally in the seemingly unwinnable        |
| conflict.                                                                    |

|  The Dokkalfar are respected as sophisticated students of magic and          |
| diplomacy, yet it is their alluring presence that makes them so compelling.  |
| The dark elves are the ultimate manipulators, controlling the actions of     |
| others from the shadows. While their reputation for subtlety is well earned, |
| many find the Dokkalfar so charismatic that they willingly parlay with them  |
| -- regardless of the consequences.                                           |

|  Though the port city of Rathir stands as a testament to their thriving      |
| culture, the relentless war against the Tuatha has put a great strain upon   |
| the Dokkalfar. The dark elves fight alongside their fairer-haired cousins,   |
| the Ljosalfar, in an attempt to push back the unyielding armies of the Fae.  |

|  Some Almain have come to the Faelands seeking freedom from the binding ties |
| of politics and religion, hoping to make their own destiny far from the      |
| rigid laws of their kingdom. Yet no matter how far they may wander from      |
| their homeland, they honor the battlefield disciplines of their ancestors.   |

to their loyal worshippers. Each race only follows five Gods and these small
bonuses can add up to turn the tide in battle, so be careful what you choose.

  Mortal creatures in Amalur believe they are born with their destinies already
woven into Fate’s grand tapestry. But when Reckoning's Fateless Hero dies and is
reborn outside the weave, the path ahead is left mysteriously open. By unlocking
and exploring Destinies, you'll plan your own path to victory, outside the
bounds of fate.

  Destinies allow you to develop and master your personal battle style, crafting
your character without the constraints of traditional classes. With Destinies, a
battle-hardened warrior can incorporate the stealthy quickness of a rogue and
the magical mastery of a sorcerer, or adopt subtle variations of them all.
Destinies can grant new powers, bonuses and combat options to help you on your
journey through Amalur.

  Some of your choices will so profoundly affect life's fabric that your destiny
will be permanently altered through Twists of Fate, unique player bonuses
granted at key moments in your adventure. Your Destiny is formed as you place
points into Might, Finesse, and Sorcery. Bonuses are associated with the Destiny
you have molded, enhancing damage and skills to suit your play style. The more
points you put into the abilities the higher you advance through the tiers.

  Move across the narrow bridge and into a new section. On the right side you
can toss the remains into the fire but straight ahead is a door where a
skeleton holds a [RUSTY SWORD]. The door will open but disregard for now and
move to your left to find an [DISPOSAL NOTES] on the table and a [SKELETON]
further along. Make your way through the door where you can hear screams and a
man. Disregard them for now and follow the path into your first battle against
some Giant Rats.

  With the vermin defeated, continue down the hallway and rescue the gnome
under attack. Jump down from the platform and fight off the Tuatha Soldiers. Be
sure to loot their corpses and the [CHEST] nearby. Ask Encel any questions you
might have, accept his [MINOR HEALING POTION x3], and proceed through the large
door he opens.

  Barrels, crates, and other wooden objects are easily broken when you attack
them. Be sure to destroy these objects everywhere you go as they hold numerous
items, but more often than not gold.
_______________________________________________________________________________

  Another short scene occurs when you reach the top of the stairway. Move across
the water to the portcullis which can be raised with the nearby lever. Break the
crates to the right as you enter the next room to find a [CHEST]. To the north
another [CHEST] hides behind crates and the [SHIELD] you were looking for is on
the nearby weapons rack. Equip the Shield and a hole is blown into the wall as
more Tuatha Soldiers attack. Defeat them and loot the [BOW] then equip it into
your secondary slot.

  Ahead are some archers, so switch to that brand new bow and pick them off.
Encel will open the next door into an area with a [CHEST] hiding behind some
crates. Kill the Tuatha Soldiers on the second level and pick up the [DAGGERS]
as you move into an area with a waterfall. To your left is a [CHEST] behind some
crates, loot it and proceed up the ramp where you must perform a stealth kill.
Slay the other Tuatha Soldiers that are just picking off the helpless then move
into the next room.

  Use your magic when told then begin looting the area. On the table to the west
is a [SPIDER MEMO] and just south of that a [CHEST]. Proceed through the
corridor and into the cave-like area. At the fork stay straight to find a
[CHEST] then double back west to find a Giant Spider. Loot the corpse for a
[STAFF] then equip it so you can burn the spider webs. Defeat the three Giant
Spiders and loot the [SPIDER SAC] before continuing south through another web.
Slay two more Giant Spiders and open the [CHEST] as you make your way into the
armory. A scene occurs and if you pass the Persuasion Check with Encel you can
receive additional [POTIONS]. Loot the three [CHESTS] and make your exit.

  Up the stairway you find the Well of Souls. Move along the left side to find
the [WELL PROGRESS LOG] then enter the Laboratory. Speak with Fomorous Hugues
and ask any questions you might have. When you are ready to go, a scene takes
over and you must escape. At the top of the steps are two Tuatha Soldiers and
to the north side of the room a [CHEST]. Proceed through the doorway and
continue your ascent, but don't pass the [CORPSE]. This next door opens up to
the first boss, the Rock Troll.

|  The Rock Troll has two attacks, a lunging forward swing used at melee and   |
| a slam that sends energy in a line towards you, often used at range. The     |
| melee attack has to be blocked or dodged, simply running to avoid the attack |
| doesn't work since the Troll can pivot quickly and still reach you. The      |
| ranged attack is easily sidestepped and can be dodged at a forward angle to  |
| quickly close the distance for melee strikes. Overall, this fight isn't that |
| difficult as long as you dodge and then counter with combinations.           |
|                                                                              |

  You most likely have gained a level, so be sure to set your skills and the
ability points. Jump off the platform nearby into the water and use the [DIVE
POINT] to find a few items. To the east you can swim behind the waterfall to
find four Giant Rats guarding quite a bit of treasure. Back in the water you
can find a second [DIVE POINT] to the far west on the opposite end. Back on the
land you can talk with the various gnomes and loot the [OVERTURNED CART].

N o t e
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Across the land you will find various flowers and herbs that can be harvested
for their reagents. They glow and have sparkles coming out of them so they are
somewhat difficult to miss. Be sure to stop at them and acquire the reagents
along your journey.
_______________________________________________________________________________


  Near the cart you can find a [SHRINE OF MITHARU] that will provide a bonus.
You can hear a gnome ask for assistance with a Bear, so provide the help via
slaughter. You can talk with Guran and perform a Persuasion Check to receive
about [100 GOLD]. As you progress south you can notice a few Wolves near a cart.
Slay them and move down this narrow path to gain access to a new area, the
Stonecandle Mines. Enter the mines and take the eastern path to find [CHEST],
but beware the bear trap in front of it. The western path leads to a few
Kobold Rogues, be careful.

  Further along is another Kobold and if you continue to move northeast you
will complete a circle. There are Kobold Rogues along the way and they aren't
the easiest of enemies to kill. Near the far east of the circular path is a
Gnome with the [STONECANDLE LOG] on his corpse. The southern part of the fork
leads to a locked [CHEST]. Leave the cave and take the other path to start a
scene with Agarth the Fateweaver. Mid-conversation you can perform a Persuasion
Check to receive [GREATER HEALTH REGEN POTION] and a [GREATER MANA REGEN
POTION].

  Tuatha Soldiers and Rogues appear and you learn how to use Reckoning. After
some more conversation you get a chance to choose your Destiny. A new objective
is added and you regain control. Loot the [SACK] then proceed east where you
will pick up the quest [SPECIAL DELIVERY]. Ahead is a [DALENTARTH STONE] that
will give you a few experience and some lore. Further ahead you will enter the
town of Gorhart. Speak with Herc Adwold to start the quest [BUILDING BRIDGES]
and speak with Father Dynwel to start [CRISIS OF FAITH].

Special Delivery
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  You can find the [CHEST] near the Inn that gives any DLC or Pre-Order gear
you might have unlocked.
_______________________________________________________________________________

  Enter the Corner Shop and sell all your excess wares then loot the
[BLACKSMITHING SUPPLIES] in the back room. You can use the Blacksmith Forge to
the right of this chest if you need to craft new weapons/armor. Head upstairs
and you can steal [RIKKA'S JOURNAL] from the dresser. Enter the Alchemy store
and speak with Nanne Hanri to start the quest [RECIPE FOR TROUBLE]. In the
basement you can unlock a [CHEST] and steal from the [BOOKSHELF] to obtain the
book [CRIPPLESPORE CAPS]. At this time you can proceed along the road and reach
the destination for the main quest or start some of the various quests that this
town has to offer.

To the Fateweaver
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Continue east along the road until you come across Ainmhi. You can start the
quest [RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW] if you decide to help him. Further along the road
you will find Penri Kell who can offer the task [REPRISAL, REPRISED]. Move south
from here and slay the beasts that attack you. Along the road you eventually
come across Arden's Hut. After the scene leave the area and move south to the
village of Canneroc. West from here along the road you can spot the remains of
a Silkfarmer from Canneroc, looting it starts the task [RESTING THE BONES].

  Make your way around the bend and you will be ambushed by a large group of
Giant Spiders and Venomspitters. As you approach Hornstead you can find an
[ETTINEMERE STONE]. Stick to the road in this area, the enemies are plentiful
and powerful. As you make your way to the objective you can loot a corpse to
start [RALLYING CRY]. Help Agarth slay the Shaman then enter Dellach.

The Theatre of Fate
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Move through the hallway into an open room with Wolves and an Ettin Brute.
You will find much of the same in the next room as well as a Dispel Ward
[CHEST]. Follow the path and open the magnificent door to find Kobolds that have
gathered. Loot the nearby [CHEST] and continue down the hallway to find a single
Kobold. Approaching it summons a horde of Kobold Rogues, so be alert and fight
them one at a time. Open the elegant door and continue along the path to another
room filled with Kobold. There is a [CHEST] in the corner on your way out of the
room into another where Kobolds are battling the Ettin.

  Further in you will fight an Ettin Warpriest. Treat the fight like the Rock
Troll and it will be a cakewalk. Attempting to hack and slash combo this foe
isn't going to work at your level. After the short scene proceed west through
the empty room but check the north and south rooms to find [CHESTS]. Continue
into a hallway with Kobold Rogues then south through a corridor and clear out
the last Kobolds as you enter the Theatre of Fate.

  The Niskaru Bloodhunters that you face are easily beaten if countered after
blocking. It becomes easy to chain combo them and with Agarth there to aid you
they go down even quicker. Loot the [CHEST] for the [BAND OF THE DUELIST] then
touch the Destiny Stone to receive the [CODEX OF DESTINY]. A short scene occurs
and you are thrown into combat. Use large area attacks to quickly fell the would
be assassins. A short scene occurs and this quest completes.

  Leave the area and loot the [CHEST] on the left before jumping down. Slay the
two Ettin Brutes and open another [CHEST] to before leaving this section. Make
your way up north past Gorguath and into the House of Ballads, you should pass
by an [ODARATH STONE] along the road as well as a locked [CHEST]. Enter the
House of Accolades and speak to Alyn Shir. Give the Codex to Glianal who
dismisses the Codex and calls is a fake. Alyn wants you to seek out the King,
but it's quite a journey. Prepare yourself for the trek and get moving to the
southeast.

  Past Canneroc you can continue east and fight off the Murghan across a bridge
where a locked [CHEST] resides. Go passed the library and over another bridge
where more Murghan lurk. You can spot Declan Malus just off the path to start
the quest [A BRUTAL CONTRACT]. Try to avoid the Mountain Trolls at this time
and continue up passed Grim Onwig will start the quest [THE GUIDED HANDS]. Move
east until you reach Vorm Lodge. This is usually a good place to make a pit stop
before heading south to your goal; you can start the side quests [AGGRESSIVE
BROWNIES] and [DANGERS OF THE SIDHE].

  Leave the inn and head south, slaying the enemies in the way until you reach
Caer Nyralim. Follow the path all the way to the top and speak with Nyralim.
With some words of wisdom and guidance, you are sent to defeat the Troll
Matriarch Gnarsh. The fastest way there is to warp to the Ballads Library and
head south. Kill the Rock Troll guarding the entrance then enter Haxhi Dam. Here
you meet up with Alyn Shir once again and she will assist you throughout this
dungeon.

  To the north another Rock Troll attacks. You should have these down pat by now
so quickly dispatch and continue north. The Tuatha seem to have made it here as
well, so kill them and move around the bend. South of here is a group of Tuatha
Raiders just sitting around. You can sneak up on them with Alyn or just charge
in full force. Move east across the bridge where a Rock Troll and two more
Tuatha Raiders are working. Kill them and continue east where four Tuatha have
their backs turned to you. As you begin to fight them a Rock Troll will burst
through the wall so be on guard.

  Further along are more Tuatha Raiders and another Rock Troll. You can craft
gems at the Sagecraft Altar and loot the two [CHESTS] in the northern alcove.
Continue east where you can find three [CHESTS] in a small alcove to the south.
Head up the stairs to find the Troll Matriarch, Gnarsh.

and report the good news. Pass the Persuasion Check and you can obtain
[NYRALIM'S GRACE]. With more words of wisdom, head to Sidhe and slay the Sprites
that appear along the road. As you move through the water you can find a [STONE
OF SIDHE]. Cross the bridges and enter The Gardens of Ysa to meet Chancellor
Erawn who completes this quest.

  Enter the Three Lamps Inn at Didenhil and talk to Agarth. You will receive a
random ring and then be on your way to the Hunter's Pit.

Hunter's Pit - West (Main Gate)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  If you chose to take the front gate then expect quite a few enemies. The first
camp is littered with foes, a use of Reckoning here is a decent choice. Loot the
[CHEST] on the west end then continue north. As you turn the corner you will
encounter more Tuatha and another [CHEST] in the northern camp. Continue east
and break the crates along the bridge to call two more Tuatha Raiders. There is
a Hidden Door to the south but it's only useful if your Detect Hidden is high
enough to see; there are three [CHESTS] behind the door.

  Further east you will find a long Tuatha Raider. Jump down into the next camp
where a large group will attack you from range. Fight fire with fire and pick
the Raiders off from distance. Break the crates to discover a hidden [CHEST]
then move up the ramp as you march east. Slay another group of Tuatha and you
will enter the main room with Agarth meeting up with you. Gadflow will be
summoned and a short scene occurs. Agarth suggests you take up the offer Alyn
Shir had earlier. Loot the [CHEST] and search the other half of the Pit before
leaving.

Hunter's Pit - East (Back Door)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Enter the back gate and kill the Tuatha Raider. You can sneak past the camp if
you want just watch out for the bear trap. Ahead is a floor trap and arrow
launcher, then another bear trap. Past the waterfall is another bear trap and a
group of Tuatha near a [CHEST]. Past here you can release the Barghests that
won't attack you but instead attack the Tuatha further along. Grab the [CHEST]
and go south to find another one. Return back to the north and pick the lock on
the door.

  Head into this room and start slaying all the Tuatha. Break the crystal and
Gadflow comes out for a chit-chat. Don't miss the [CHEST] and search the other
half of the Pit before leaving.

  Make your way into Detyre by following the road east. Once there you can
encounter a woman named Frama Aedic who starts the side quest [KIDNAPPED]. Keep
to the road or short-cut through the dangerous wild as you make your way across
Alserund and into the Hollowlands. The joint path has several Boggarts but
nothing of concern. Stop by Eagonn's Tomb for a travel location then go south
past the Motus Mining Outpost and button hook around to reach Templar Octienne
at the Overlook Camp. Head south in search of Fomorous Hugues and into the
Saltwell Caverns.

  Kill the Faer Gorta in the entrance and smash some crates to find two [CHESTS]
and on one of the tables [SALTWELL LAB NOTES, DAY 21]. Loot the [LAB KEY] from
the Gnome Corpse in the next room. Several Sons of Laz, slow moving Zombie-like
creatures, appear to kill you. Use the key to open the next door where more
Sons of Laz appear. Kill them and open the [CHEST], grab [SALTWELL SITE LAB
NOTES, DAY 142] and loot the Gnome Corpse for the [EMERGENCY SUPPLY KEY]. You
can use this key to open one of the [CHESTS] in the first room if you couldn't
unlock it or save it for one that's ahead.

  Be careful of the tripwire on the way into the corridor, as well as the arrow
launcher trap. Kill the Faer Gorta Sentinels that attack in the next room and
snag [SALTWELL SITE LAB NOTES, DAY 233] off the northern table. As you continue
east there is an incinerator at the southern end. Wake the Sons of Laz and use
the lever to incinerate them for easy experience. There is also a [CHEST] in
this area but beware the Spike Traps. The next room has several Sons of Laz and
as you fight them off several more spawn from the direction you came. Loot the
Gnome Corpse for another [EMERGENCY SUPPLY KEY] then open the door south.

  To the east are a few Faer Gorta and two [CHESTS]. Continue south to start a
short scene with Hugues then defend him from the White Palm. Speak with Hugues
then loot the two [CHESTS] and be on your way.

  Set your compass east and get moving, you have to cross through two entire
zones just to get to the Templar Jorielle. As you cross into Menetyre you can
find a Hidden Door that leads to a few new objects. You will also pass two
[STONES OF THE HOLLOWLANDS] and a [STONE OF SPRING]. Take a straight shot across
this zone and at the juncture to Apotyre you will find the first [APOTYRE STONE]
Continue east until you approach the Darkvari Outlaws, one of which drops the
[MOTUS MINING DOCUMENTS]. Reading this note starts the task [WHITESTONE
TARNISHED].

  Continue your journey to Adessa where you can spot a [STONE OF SUMMER]. You
are stopped and questioned as you enter the city and then given the [VILLA KEY]
to enter your new home. Venture south and enter the Domus Politica and go up
the stairs to find Templar Jorielle. She isn't buying what you're selling but
tells you of a way to prove your point. As you exit you are stopped and given
the location and direction of your task. Seek out Octienne in the Livrarium and
chase after him as he escapes.

|  The most important thing to remember is that you cannot kill Octienne until |

| Whitepalms that he continually unveils as you chase him, they must be        |
| defeated in order for Octienne to continue running. Dodging will be your     |
| best friend as Octienne shoots Fire and Ice balls that can bombard you       |
| repeatedly, leaving you open to the minions. Reckoning is always a good      |
| option when you get in trouble just remember that there are quite a few      |
| stops where you must fight. After the final stop begin to pummel Octienne.   |
| Keep dodging his attacks use stuns to keep him locked down.                  |

  Alyn Shir wanted you to meet her in Emaire and it's going to be quite the
venture from anything you've likely discovered. Fast Travel as close as you can
and start the journey. As you enter the Plains of Erathell you can find a
graveyard with a [STONE OF THE WOLDS] inside. You should also pass by the
village of Ayten for an easy travel location. If you stick to the road you will
find another [STONE OF THE WOLDS] just before moving into the Forsaken Plain.
Be on the lookout for Freeman Assassins, they tend to ambush along the roads.

  Continue north and the main road leads straight into Emaire. Enter the Blue
Bear Tavern and speak with Alyn Shir. The poor General is still in exile and is
fated to never succeed. You must head to Urul-Tusk in the Cradle of Summer to
the northwest. As you follow the road north you can spot a [CRADLE OF SUMMER
STONE] off the right side of the path; there is also another just before you
cross into the zone itself. A third [CRADLE OF SUMMER STONE] can be found if you
go west as soon as you enter the zone near a jump point.

N o t e

  There is a Hidden Door in this zone that leads to rare items. To find this,
head east of Urul Tusk, just on the other side of the river. Follow the path and
loot the hidden object for the [SKILL BOOK (ALCHEMY)] then jump down to find a
[GRAVE] by itself with [KHAS-TI'S HELM].

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  When you finally reach Urul-Tusk speak with General Tilera. Accept the [ERATHI
WINDCHIME] and use it on the Ancient Windstone to the west. A Niskaru
Bloodhunter will strike when the windstone is struck so be ready for the fight.
You are left with the task of finding the other four Ancient Windstones and
striking them to open the gate. Do this however you wish, just know that without
Fast Travelling it could take some time.

  The Windstone in Tala-Rane will summon two Niskaru and is in the central part
of this zone. South of Caer Tosai is where you will find the Kandrian Windstone.
In the northeast corner of Acatha the Windstone will summon four Niskaru
Bloodhunters after you; there is also a [CHEST] and [WHIRPOOL] nearby. The
final Windchime in the Forsaken plain will bring about a Niskaru Tyrant. Be
careful as this one can be dangerous. Behind the stone you can loot [KALLAS'
NOTES] and then be on your way back to the Urul-Tusk. A disturbance occurs and
you are teleported to the Deep Slumber. You have broken the barrier and you can
restore it, but those side quests can be accomplished at your leisure.

  Return to Urul-Tusk and go inside, moving west through the narrow pathway.
As you approach a fork in the road three Niskaru spawn to ambush you. There is
a locked [CHEST] to the north, grab it before continuing west. As you approach a
staircase turn left and loot the [CHEST] at the end of the corridor. Move down
the steps and kill three more Niskaru and loot the [CHEST] in the southeastern
corner. Head west and two Niskaru Hunters come running into the room where a
[CHEST] also resides.

  Go through the winding chasms south and then eventually back north where you
will find Giant Rats. Beyond the rats is a room with two [CHESTS] and a hidden
passageway going east -- use the Erathi Sigil-Stone to progress. Two more
Niskaru Hunters lurk in this room as well as a [CHEST]. Get ready for a tough
fight before progressing up the stairs.

|  After the short scene two Niskaru Hunters strike at you. When these two are |
| defeated three more appear to whittle down your life. Azaghaal makes his     |
| appearance once these Niskaru fall. At melee range the beast can use a tail  |
| spin that knocks you back a ways. Azaghaal can also stretch his arms and     |
| cause magical damage to you as well as shoot frost breath and fire balls     |
| from his mouth. The charge attack will leave you stunned but dodging it      |
| leaves the foe open. The best attacks to counter are the frost breath and    |
| charge so focus on closing the distance with a dodge roll. Azaghaal can be   |
| stunned and paralyzed but it's very infrequent. Stick to dodging and         |
| countering when Azaghaal is still using his attacks.                         |

  Make the journey to Rathir and head to the Upper City. Get Elund Carth to
send troops with you to Mel Senshir, if you pass the Persuasion Check you can
even leave with [ELUND'S RING]. Go back down the steps and to the dock to sail
to Mel Senshir. Speak with Commander Owaiglyn upon your arrival. Listen to the
plan he has to unravel the Tuatha and talk to him again once you are ready.

  Begin your onslaught heading north taking out a single Tuatha Soldier then
a group of three. Go up the steps and through the gate, turning right to grab
a [CHEST]. There are two more locked [CHESTS] in this room but you might not
have time to loot them before two Tuatha Priests enter to ruin your day. Watch
out for the traps in the next corridor. It's not difficult to dodge roll by
them if you know they are there. At the balcony you need to break the siege
ladders and fight off the Tuatha with Alyn Shir.

  In the next area the path is split, go whichever way you want and try to
save your comrades. Open the door and cut through the enemies on the next
balcony, but don't forget to cut down the siege ladder. You can find five
[CHESTS] and a Blacksmithing Forge in the next room. Utilize whatever you need
and head out to the Ramparts. Slay the few Tuatha that are in your way then
head down the path for a dual with the Witch Knight Malwyn.

with Agarth's assistance then continue north to fight off three more soldiers.
Loot the [CHEST] then head up the steps and clear the balcony. Head back inside
to find more Tuatha then go through the gate to find a Prismere Troll. Clear
the room and loot the [CHEST] then head out to an overhang. The Balor is firing
his laser eye in a semi-circle here. You can dodge it and grab the [CHEST]
contents then dart into the next area.

  Slay the Tuatha Zealots and enter a fierce fight with a Tuatha Priest and
a Niskaru Tyrant. Kill the priest first and use stuns to keep the Tyrant back.
Head out to the Ramparts to start the fight against the monstrous Balor.

  Leave the castle and head outside to find Cydan. Trek through the Cursewood
until you are stopped by Bisarane on your way to meet with Cydan. He will ask
that you join the House of Sorrows, doing so starts the quest [THE SORROWS
CALL]. Enter Foes' Hearth and speak with Cydan for guidance on how to strike
at Gadflow. He notions taking down the Prismere Chantries spread across
Klurikon.

  The first Prismere Chantry is in the northwest of the Drowned Forest. There
are several Tuatha Raiders here and nothing more. After the short conversation
with Gadflow, break the crystal and be on your way to the next Chantry in the
southeast corner. You'll find much of the same here, destroy the crystals and
be on your way to the northeastern corner of The Keening. Return to Cydan to
complete the quest and receive [CYDAN'S FAEBLADES] along with a hefty amount of
gold.

  Leave the cavern and head south into the Caeled Coast. You will undoubtedly
pass by a [CAELED COAST STONE] on your way to meet Alyn Shir. After the speech
head to Dannestar Isle. Slay the Sons of Laz that spawn then enter Dannestar
Tower. Kill the group of Sons of Laz then head up the stairs where Alyn Shir
most likely already tripped the trap. Fight off the Faer Gorta then follow the
path to a [CHEST]. Using the lever releases a Faer Gorta for your slaughtering.
Continue east up the stairs to find another group of Laz.

  Loot the two [CHESTS] and grab the [LAZ REMAINS] from the desk then dash
through the door. Watch out for the falling rocks if you haven't been, they
start to pick up. Slay the Son of Laz and check the nearby crates for [AN
INVESTMENT] as you march west to another group of Laz. Further along the path
you will encounter a mixture of Faer Gorta and Sons of Laz. There is a locked
[CHEST] in the back corner that you should open before continuing.

  Go south and up a set of stairs to encounter a group of Ancient Leanashe.
After that slightly challenging encounter, keep west and turn south up the steps
to a room with four [CHESTS] and the note [THE NEW ASSISTANT]. Meet Ventrinio
to the east near the Well then hold off the Sons of Laz as they strike. Faer
Gorta and Ancient Leanashe will join the fray the longer you hold out and
Ventrinio will start to aid you. Talk with Ventrinio after you've completed the
task to receive the [SOUL LENS] and complete the quest.

junction of the north and south parts. Stick to the main road and at the fork
you can find another [CAELED COAST STONE]. Continue east and kill the Borgan
Brutes and check the the west side of cliff for another [CAELED COAST STONE]
then head to the House of Pride..

  Meet with Dren and fight a quick and pointless battle. There is a Persuasion
Check during the speech but all options point to a fight to the death.

|  Dren is a Fighter and uses high tier skills in that area. His combos are    |

| Keeping distance is easy and Storm Bolt provides an easy stun. Reckoning     |

the House of Pride and fight alongside the Allies. Kill the three Tuatha Priests
in the first room then prepare for a larger group in the next. Loot the [CHEST]
and head into the next room where a Bolgan Brute and Tuatha Overlord await with
their lackies. The Overlord can present a challenge so focus on him first. Loot

  Make your exit into Alabastra and talk to Alyn Shir. Move down the road into
Camp Moondown, if you go west and north past it you can find an [ALABASTRA
STONE]. Follow the road until you run into Ventrinio again who briefs you.
Check the [STONE OF WINTER] and loot the [CHEST] to the south then continue
along the road. Enter Shadow Pass and fight off the Tuatha as you will pass
another [ALABASTRA STONE].

  Further along, before you leave Shadow Pass, a Prismere Troll impedes your
path. It can still be difficult so be sure to exercise all necessary precautions
while fighting it. South from here you can meet Cydan and find a third
[ALABASTRA STONE]. Down the road you can find Witch Knight Dessidyn in the
camp. Enter the Twilight Pass and slay the few Tuatha that ambush you before
snagging another [ALABASTRA STONE]. Pass through Ashmoor and turn north to find
a few Sprites and another [STONE OF WINTER]. Just past the Eventide you can find
the final [ALABASTRA STONE] . Turn the corner of the long path to meet Cydan
who is in turn waiting for Agarth, who seems to show up right on time.

  Alyn Shir is missing, but the group is ready when you are. Fight your way to
the top of the hill where you can find a [STONE OF WINTER] sitting before the
entrance to the House of Vengeance. Kill the Tuatha and continue to follow the
group to another group of Tuatha. The next group you fight is a somewhat
elaborate room where you can find two [CHESTS]. There isn't much of note until
you reach the top and face the Cur of Vengeance.

the pathway. Slay the Niskaru and find the next [BHAILE STONE]. Cross the
bridge and slay a few more Tuatha as the third [BHAILE STONE] is on this island.
Around the bend you will face a Prismere Troll and find the fourth [BHAILE
STONE] along with another [STONE OF WINTER]. The final [BHAILE STONE] is in the
northwest corner before you reach the Court of Winter, there is also a [CHEST]

Quest Giver: Father Dynwel
Location:    Gorhart

  Start this quest after clearing the Red Legion Camps in Recipe for Trouble.
To the west of the last camp you can spot several Brownies. Slay them and move
south to find a hollow log leading into the central area. Help Brother Egan
kill the Boggarts then speak with him. Agree to help then follow him to
Waterhall Downs. There is a [LOOT PILE] to the north, but proceed in the other
direction. Slay the Boggarts and move through the watery area, don't bypass the
[WHIRLPOOL] that is sure to reap rewards. At the end of the watery passageway
is a [LOOT PILE] containing [350 COINS] and [AMMAN'S KEY - AUTUMN]. Moving near
the pile unfortunately summons Sprites that surround you.

  Further along you will encounter more Sprites and a [CHEST]. This chest has
traps all around it so be careful. Your reward is the [SELKIE VEIL] and a few
more Sprites that appear to guard the treasure. To the right of this chest is
another [CHEST] hidden behind some pots. Exit back into Odarath and loot the
[CHEST] before jumping down. When you return to the camp and talk to the "Fae"
you can pass a Persuasion Check to avoid combat, but either option lets you keep
the Veil.

  Follow Brother Egan back to the mission and unlock the [CHEST] to the left as
you enter the newly opened gate. Speak with the Father to receive your reward.

plague. Head north and enter the cavern, making your way to a small camp with

and close range smashes. Stuns work well for setting them up to die. Once the
Jottun are defeated loot the [CHEST] and head down the hall.

beasts to include a Chieftain. Pop open the [CHESTS] on the western side then
head north where you can find a third and the entrance to the Coilsbain Ruins.

  There is a [CHEST] by the waterfall so don't miss it before heading through
the elegant door. Fight off a singular Jottun then slay the final two on a
circular platform around the corner. Go through the next door and slay the mage
Balthasar. Ignore the Faer Gorta as he continues to summon them and they all
disappear once he is slain anyways. Read the [ANCIENT TOME] and loot the [CHEST]

  Venture to the northwest corner of Webwood to find Castle Yolvan. The normal
entrance is destroyed so go around the corner and jump down. Search the [YOLVAN
STONE] in the initial room and head north. At the end of this hall is another
[YOLVAN STONE]. Enter the main halls and go straight across, following this path
to another [YOLVAN STONE]. At the end of the hall is a [CHEST], loot it and go
west. Defeat the Giant Rats and scope out the [SPIDER SAC] as you enter the west
corner. Watch out for the deceptive venus fly trap if you attempt to harvest the
reagent.

  Just south you will find the fourth [YOLVAN STONE] and a group of Giant Rats.
Head west and south to the final [YOLVAN STONE] then move towards The Widow.
Don't pass up the [SPIDER SACS] and [SKELETONS] along the way, they can hold
valuable items. The Widow leaves as Giant Spiders and Venomspitters appear. If
you have Mark of Flame now would be an optimal time to use it, though you could
also use Reckoning and collect a large amount of experience.

Quest Giver: The Widow
Location:    Castle Yorvan
Requirement: Complete Cutting the Threads

  Start backtracking and watch out for the Venomspitters that spawn in the
hallway. In the first large room you reach a group of Giant Spiders will ambush
you. The same thing applies for the next two larger rooms as you return to the
middle. Go northwest and unlock the gate and fight off the Giant Rats to find a
[CHEST] and [SPIDER SAC] worth looting. Head straight across the hall and kill
the last Venomspitters on your back to Yolvan. As you enter the village a group
of spiders spawns and you must defend the citizens.

  With some guidance from Barten, head south to Cathrus. The Widow presents the
option of wiping out Canneroc, but choose not to. Go south and fight off the
Venomspitters and in the hallway use a staff/sceptre to break the web and reach
a locked [CHEST]. In the nearby room you will encounter a few waves of spiders
so be ready to continually fight and back into the hallway if you need to
funnel them down. Follow the zigzag path southwest and break the web at the
turning point to find a [SPIDER SAC].

  The path leads southwest still to another room full of spiders. Just outside
this room is a web that you can break to reach another [SPIDER SAC] and as you
move northwest you can find another one. Follow the path as you slay the spiders
until you face off with The Widow.

Requirement: Complete The Commendation

  Seek out Castellan Tine Delfric in Shieldring Keep. Head to the southern part
of east Odarath to find the Keep. You receive your first mission from Tine and
you need to reach Didenhil. Search the southwestern hall for a [CHEST] that
won't require you to steal, a [WEAPON RACK], and the services that are provided.
Enter the Healer's Cottage in Didenhil and speak with Wyl Rendig then head east
into Lorca-Rane.

  Begin searching the clues that are along the path east. Crand is the lucky
victim as you come across the last clue. Regroup with Ost then scour the area
for more clues. Another person is slain as you find the last clue again.
After grouping up again, approach the wagon to spawn a Niskaru Bloodhunter. If
this is your first time facing this creature be prepared for what could be a
difficult dual. Alone, the Niskaru aren't as challenging but in groups they can
be devastating.

  As Ost pays his respects, loot the cart and the [CHEST] then follow him as
you head after the Niskaru. Enter Brigand Hall Caverns as [THE HEART OF SIBUN]
begins.

  Follow Ost Ordura into the halls and avoid the traps that are strewn across
your path. Once you cross the first hall, Ost will send you around to open the
gate. Jump down to the east and avoid the traps as you move around to the lever.
With high Detect Hidden you can disarm the traps if you can't dodge them. Move
through the next passageway to spawn some Niskaru. Loot the corpses and check
the [WEAPON RACK], then destroy some crates to find a locked [CHEST].

  Open the door and move east, but beware the bear traps. Search the next camp
for corpses and a [WEAPON RACK] then Ost will stop you. Enter the final camp
and fight the Fahrlangi Cultists and their Archmage. With the summoners down
the Niskaru appear and Ost means an untimely demise. Carry on his task and
loot the [CHEST] in the northern corner. Continue east and when you turn the
corner south start looking out for mine traps.

  Clear out the next camp of the Fahrlangi Swordsman and a Niskaru. Check the
corpses and dispel the three [CHESTS], but again watch out for the mines as
they are craftly placed. Prepare for a challenge in a Niskaru Tyrant, the last
monster of this damned cave. This monster can shoot fireballs and has an array
of attacks. Spells like Storm Bolt that can stun the beast should make it an
easier kill. Loot the [CHEST] to find the [PERFIDIOUS CAP] and loot the Tyrant
for the [PERFIDIOUS GLOVES]. Pick up the [HEART OF SIBUN] and return to
Shieldring Keep then report to Tine Delfric. You receive the [STERN HELM] as
your reward for completing this task and the quest ends.

Mages. Focus on them one at a time then scour the area for quite a few [CHESTS]
On the upper floor you have to unlock a side door to reach the [CHEST], just
beware the Spike Trap. On the opposite side is a Hidden Door with another
[CHEST] behind it. Return to Helmgard Keep and talk with the Castellan. He has
jailed Gwyn so talk to her and get the key, then return to Grian with the

  Grian wants you to head to the locksmith in Tirin's Rest. It's a long journey
so be prepared before heading off. Enter the Locksmith building and go down into
the lab. Head to the northeast and grab two [CHESTS] then defeat the three

entrance to Gorguath. To your immediate right is a [GORGUATH STONE], so read it
and enter the middle section. After the brief scene go south and kill the
Brownies. Continue south to find another [GORGUATH STONE] and a [CHEST] then
backtrack to where you killed the Brownies.

  Go north this time and defeat a larger group of Brownies and take the short
path southeast for a [CHEST]. Stick to the path until you reach the Heartvine
that you need to pull. Go north into a larger with a few Brownies and another
[CHEST]. Continue along the path to the next Heartvine then enter the next area
to the north for a change of pace, Boggarts. There is still a [CHEST] in the
north part of the room but also a Hidden Door that you can see on the minimap
with enough points in Detect Hidden. At the end of the hallway is a third
[GORGUATH STONE].

  Backtrack to the room before this hallway and go northwest to defeat the
Boggarts. Go south to the final Heartvine then clear the remaining Boggarts as
you return to the entrance hall. Go down the center and through the Hidden Door
on the left to reach the bottom layer of all the stuff you just ran around.
Slay the Boggarts and find a few [CHESTS] then return to the center area to face
the Grave Thresh. Fire spells work wonders and the Thresh is rarely stunned, but
the fire can stagger.

  With the creature felled you can loot the [CORPSES] in the corners and a
[CHEST] along the wall. Go north to a [GORGUATH STONE] then loot the corpse in
the middle of the room for the [BALLADS SIGNET RING] and [FAEBLADES OF SONG].
A short scene occurs and a roar of the impending danger should send a warning
sign, another Thresh is coming. Defeat the Thresh in the south and slay the
Boggars to find a [CORPSE]. Clear out the northern area as well then go north
east of the larger room find the last [GORGUATH STONE].

  Loot the [SKELETON] as well then fight your way out of Gorguath. Return to the

and you can see they are in the four corners. They don't stay visible for long
so use the whistle when you are close to reveal the crystal for breaking. When
they are all broken, monsters become hostile again and you need to return to
Sagrell. He will give you the [BELL TOWER KEY] and [HOUSE OF BALLADS SHIELD] and
be on his way.

  Enter the Bell Tower and loot two [CHESTS] then pull the rope and enter Castle
Windemere.

Location:    Castle Windemere
Requirement: Complete Cursed Kingdom

  Check the [WINDEMERE STONE] in front of you and be on your way to savings the
Court of Enchantments. The first member is Sir Farrara who fights with a few
Sprites. Check the southeastern alcove for a [WINDEMERE STONE] before moving on.
Watch out for the venus fly traps as you move into the next room. Fight off the
Boggar Plaguebearers and stay out of the poisonous water while you battle. Go
right and fight off a pair of Leanashe in the library area. Here you can save
Queen Belmaid and Dame Oleyn but the two make a good pairing and two Leanashe
join them. Fire spells will put down the creatures and stuns will keep the
ladies in check.

  Search the southeastern room for a [CHEST] and the north one for the third
[WINDEMERE STONE]. Return to the center room and shoot across, fighting off a
horde of Boggarts. The next room has a [WINDEMERE STONE] visible from the
entrance but everything has poisonous water. You'll likely contract a disease
and you will slowly take damage. The northern room has two [CHESTS] but the
southern one has the King and a [CHEST]. Follow the King back to the main area
and he will unlock the magical barrier.

  You receive the [KING'S TOKEN] and the King leaves. Approach the door and
talk with the Maid of Windemere for the last time.

  Head to Ohn's Stand in southwestern Lorca-Rane. Head west and unlock the gate
to find a [SKELETON]. Turn around and go north this time slaying the enemies
then talking to Grim Onwig. Head to the northeast and open the Hidden Door to
find two [CHESTS]. Take the path southwest to find a Gnomish Sentry in a camp.
Further into the camp you'll battle Sorcerers. You can open the gates and find
[SKELETONS] in them most of the time. When you are done, take the southwest path
that heads southeast to a Centurion Gastet.

  Loot his corpse for the [CENTURION'S KEY] then loot the three [CHESTS] to find
[GRIM'S STEALTH KIT]. Kill the Gnomes ahead then use the [LEVER] to open the
door and return to Grim. You can opt to keep his kit but it's not worth much.
Though Grim is freed, it is worth searching the northern half of the area for
the [CHESTS]. Just beware the Jottun and the Spike Traps along the way. Return
to Crilgarin who is, unfortunately, in no longer need of your services. Head to

  The Moon Camp is just outside of Rathir. Speak to Irion, King of Cups who
seems lost over his love Maire. Pray at the Hierophant Shrine to get the list
of whom you must steal from. Start with the Seafoam Tavern in Rathir where you
can steal the [CHALICE OF FORCED VINTAGE]. The best way to approach this is to
wait at the top of the stairs until Veinrich moves the far bench where you can
sneak up and snag the chalice.

  Stealing the [WYVYRN-GIFRE SIGNET RING] is arguably the easiest one because
you can just stealth behind Ebsol and take the ring. Enter the Temple of Lyria
and speak with Maire, Queen of Cups where you can persuade or purchase the
final piece, the [COWL OF THE MAIDEN]. Return to Irion to receive [IRION'S

  Take the alternate exit to find three more [CHESTS]. Kill the Freeman in the
first room and dodge the blades as you ascend the staircase. Use the [LEVER] at
the end to open the Hidden Door and exit. Proceed south along the eastern border
to eventually reach The Blackened Hall. Loot [GRIM'S STASH] and head north to
find a [STONE OF AUTUMN]. Open the door to the east and put on [BURU'S BOOTS].
Run across the spikes and you will be unharmed. Likewise, you can just disarm
the traps and take your time crossing the hall.

  At the far end Buru's Boots wear off. There is another hall with traps but
you can run between them. Fire crashes down towards you so run down the right
side and be fast about it! Use the Erathi Sigil-Stone to difuse the flames then
square off against the Niskaru. Loot the [CHEST] a the southern end for the
[JOURNAL OF SCRIBE PEARSE, VOL. 1]. In the western room you can cross another
trapped floor, but be careful. Sprinting down the row two from the right seems
to get you through unphased, but will require a stutter step right before you
finish crossing.

  Loot the two [CHESTS] and use the far right path going back, applying the same
stutter step to cross unharmed. Enter the eastern hallway and about halfway down
open the Hidden Door to reveal a [CHEST]. As you reach another circular room,
three Niskaru will strike at you from different directions. Head south and slay
another group of Niskaru and loot the [CHEST] at the southern end then progress
north.

  Continue to follow the path as doors open and close around you, limiting your
exploration and choice of direction. At another circular room you will fight
three Niskaru. Follow the path south to another group of Niskaru and a [CHEST].
Turn north past three more Niskaru and west across the hall with another. In
the last room you can find two [CHESTS], one with the [JOURNAL OF SCRIBE PEARSE,
VOL. 3]. Approach The Guardian as it climbs up; it's a Niskaru Tyrant variant.
Defeat this beast and plant the Amulet of Rithen in it then take the [TEAR OF
MITHARU] from it's corpse. Snag the [GLASS AMBIENT] off the altar and make your
way back.

  As you exit you should notice that all the doors are unlocked now. Just before
reaching the second circular room turn south to find a [CHEST] with [THE JOURNAL
OF SCRIBE PEARSE, VOL.2] inside. From the second circular room head north to
find a [CHEST]. Return to the entrance and speak with Grim for your reward.

quite upset about this box. Head out north to the Motus Mining Headquarters.
Talk to Guian who humbly refuses then search the northern cobwebbed room for a

Sprites appear as you loot it so kill them and check the [SKELETON] along the
wall guarded by Fire Mines. The southern room has a High Priest and two normal
Priests of Vraekor, the former holds [THE PRIMER OF FIRE]. Loot the [CHEST] and
move west to another group of Sprites.

  Slay the flying beasts and move past a single mine as you move to a narrower
hallway filled with them. Loot the [CHEST] in the corner and go north to find
two Shrines and Nuala Ignas. The witch is fire resistant and summons Sprites
to her dirty work. Dodge the few spells she throws at you and loot the two
[CHESTS] for the [BOOTS OF THE DARK EMPYREAN] and her corpse for the [SUN
STONE]. Follow the path out and don't pass the two [CHESTS] before returning to
Engar.

{{{
  Alchemy allows you to craft various potions that can aid you in your endeavors
throughout Amalur. Each point you invest increases your chances of receiving
reagents when you attempt to harvest them. Certain Milestones let you create new
potions but investing to the maximum level isn't recommended.

Level 1 Milestone - A failed experiment now results in an Unstable Potion.
Level 3 Milestone - You can craft potions with three reagents.
Level 5 Milestone - You can craft potions with four reagents.
Level 10 Milestone - All alchemic recipes discovered.

  Achieving the level five Milestone is the minimum requirement for making
Master level potions but you may want to invest more points into Alchemy so you
harvest reagents more often.

                                 Blacksmithing                        [17.02.00]
________________________________________________________________________________

{{{
  Blacksmithing lets you salvage parts from weapons and armor, then turn around
and make your own awesome weapons and armor. When Blacksmithing you always
choose a core component that effects the base damage of a weapon or base armor
on defensive items. From least effective to most effective (in level increments
of 0,10,20,30,40):

    Hides - Leather, Boiled Leather, Studded Leather, Trollhide, Dreadscale
    Cloth - Cotton, Linen, Silk, Hexweave, Spiritweave
    Metal - Iron, Steel, Azurite, Sylvanite, Prismere
    Wood  - Birch, Elm, Oak, Ashe, Ebony

  The charts below detail which components go into crafting an item. Note that
chest pieces are the only ones that can be crafted with an Epic Gem.

  Sagecrafting is the art of crafting gems and socketing, or removing, them
into your equipment to improve them. Different levels of Sagecraft let you
craft different levels of gems and all levels increase your chance to
successfully harvest reagents. The creations below are made using Pristine
Shards, but lesser shards still generate the same result just with a lower
value.

  There are other gems that can be created with the same effects but the ones
listed below have the highest values. Example; Lightning + Lightning can yield a
Gem of Sparks but it only does 17 Lightning Damage and 8 Damage over 7 seconds
whilst the Gem of Tempest does 30 and 15 over time.

09 Feb 12 - Initial Release. Adding Skill Books, Sagecrafting, and some of the
Ver 0.10    faction quests next. If you want to see more, please send me an
            e-mail with what you want covered.

13 Feb 12 - Updated a lot more then I figured I would. Walkthrough, Alchemy,
Ver 0.50    Sagecrafting, House of Ballads and half of Warsworn done. Revamped
            the look and sorting of the Side Quests and added more Lorestone
            Locations.

23 Feb 12 - Monstrous update. I think I've added every single side quest in the
Ver 1.00    game. All factions are complete. Crafting Complete?
